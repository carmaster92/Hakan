# Hakan Libraries
Hakan Libraries is a UI design help tool that allows you to make a rough design of a c ertain UI before actually implementing it to see if you like it.
Hakan is Open Source, and should be used in cases where you want to see or draft what one UI design would look like.
All Credits for Hakan Libraries go to carmaster92.
